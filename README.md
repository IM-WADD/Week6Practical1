# Practical7

Today you’re going to be working in pairs or 3s to conduct a usability analysis of TicketMaster, using the Petrie and Power web usability heuristics.

When conducting a formal usability analysis, the first step is usually to construct a persona. A couple of personas have been provided for you below. You may choose to expand on these if you wish.

## Personas
### Harriet
Harriet is a 26-year-old woman who is a PhD student at the University of York, working on a PhD in Medieval History. Harriet loves music and regularly goes to gigs and music festivals, either by herself or with her friends or boyfriend.

She tries to go and see live music whenever she can and will often go to a gig even if she doesn’t know the band very well, just because she loves to see live music. She tries to go to at least 1 gig a month, but often goes to more than that. Harriet is on a fairly low income and has a strict budget, but she supplements her PhD stipend with pay from teaching. This additional pay is usually spent on fun nights out, including going to gigs. Harriet has a young person’s railcard, which means she can travel from York to Manchester and Leeds fairly cheaply and still get home after a gig without having book a hotel. This connectivity to bigger cities is one of the reasons she loves living in York. Harriet’s preferred music style is alternative/goth/indie/rock and her favourite bands include The Go! Team, The Flaming Lips and Bloc Party, but she has recently started getting into dance music and DJ sets and has been loving Mr Scruff.

### Stéphane and Charlotte
Stéphane is a professional 42-year-old man who is married to Charlotte, 36, who is a stay at home mother who takes care of their 3 children under the age of 10. Stéphane works in the city of London, but the family relocated to the leafy suburbs of Buckinghamshire when their oldest son was born. This move has been wonderful for the family, but Stéphane now has a 90-minute commute on the train/tube every day. When they lived in London, Stéphane and Charlotte used to love going to see live music shows together, but with 3 young kids they don’t get the opportunity very often. Once a year, the couple like to take a city break holiday that includes tickets to a big concert while the in-laws babysit for the weekend. Charlotte prefers pop music but Stephane is a bit more of a rocker so they usually alternate which style of band they go to see. Last year, they went to see Radiohead in Manchester, the year before they went to see Little Mix in London.

## Exercise 1: Task Design
Design tasks that each of the personas described previously may wish to complete when using Ticketmaster. Work on developing 2 tasks per persona (e.g. 4 tasks in total). Think about what the user is trying to achieve (i.e. their goal) and the context in which they may be undertaking the task (e.g. on a phone on his daily commute). Make these tasks detailed and fairly complex. Note down these tasks. 

## Exercise 2: Usability Analysis
Open TicketMaster on your mobile phone, tablet or computer (depending on what is most relevant to the context of your first task) (http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/). 

Using the spreadsheet provided in this repo and the Petrie and Power Heuristics (on the VLE), complete each of the tasks for your personas. (Only up to the point of booking a ticket, don’t pay for anything!) 

At each point in the task, analyse the website’s usability and note down any problems that you encounter through simple statements that describe the problem. Record which of the Petrie and Power web usability heuristics each usability problem violates.

Do not try to pose solutions to problems at this stage, or explain in detail why it is a problem, just create short statements that describe the problem. Rate each problem on a scale from 1 = cosmetic, 2 = minor, 3 = major and 4 = catastrophic. You may also wish to adopt the method of a collaborative heuristic evaluation (CHE) where all group members rate problems separately and then average and discuss problems/ratings at the end of the evaluation. 

## Exercise 3: Report
Imagine that TicketMaster has employed you to perform the usability analysis conducted in exercises 1 and 2. In your groups, you are going to work on developing a short report for TicketMaster that describes the usability problems you encountered and proposes solutions to them.

Your report should explain which problems are most important to be fixed, and which are less important. Consider the idea of “low hanging fruit”, i.e. the problems that are simple to fix but would have a big impact on improving the usability, as some issues (e.g. restructuring the IA of the site) may require a whole redesign of the site, but other issues are easier to fix.

You will be asked to present your findings, first to one or two other groups, then to the whole class.
